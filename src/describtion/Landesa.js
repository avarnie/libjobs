        <p class="italic font-bold">Background</p>
            <p>Landesa is an international nonprofit, founded in 1981, and dedicated to ending global poverty
by securing land rights for the world’s rural farmers. Landesa has worked in 50 countries
throughout the world, with a home office in Seattle, WA, and field offices in Monrovia, Dar es
Salaam, Beijing, and multiple offices in Inda. The organization is widely supported by partners,
including NGOs, foundations, donor agencies (USAID, World Bank, etc.), world leaders,
educational institutions, and individual supporters throughout the world. Landesa is known for its
advancement of pro-poor, gender-sensitive land rights reforms that have helped alleviate
poverty, reduce hunger, and ease conflict over land for more than 540 million women and men.
Landesa’s Land Rights for Sustainable Development program in Liberia focuses on supporting
customary communities to obtain legal rights to their land. With an interest in providing inputs
for a manual on climate-sensitive land management planning for communities undergoing
customary land formalization, Landesa is designing a qualitative research study to i) understand
the effects of climate change on the livelihoods of women, men, and youth in communities
undergoing customary land formalization; and ii) explore how effective response to climate
change impacts can be incorporated into community land use planning. The research
methodology includes: participatory action research with local communities; and key informant
interviews with community leaders and local organizations involved in climate change
interventions and programming. The consultant will be responsible for implementing the study in
3 communities in Bong County and Margibi County.</p><br />
